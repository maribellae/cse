3) Task about Linearized System of Inverted Pendulum - *linearized.pdf* and beautiful paper with the results of simulation *paper_w_simulation.pdf*

4) Task about Inverted Pendulum (RL) - *RL_pendulum.ipynb* (I couldn't open the presentation with the task because the file is too large, so I did it myself through the torchRL library that I know)
